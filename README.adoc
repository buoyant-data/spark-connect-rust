A link:https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html[Spark
Connect] client implementation in Rust. This repository provides both a Rust
library for interacting with Spark Connect APIs and also a simple command line
for sending Spark SQL commands to any Spark Connect endpoint.

== Building

Building can be done with link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/[cargo] by invoking `cargo build` and `cargo test`


== Using

=== CLI

The `spark-connect-cli` binary can be used to run Spark SQL commands against the Spark Connect server, for example:

----
% cargo run --bin spark-connect-cli
>> create temporary view people as select current_date();
+-------------+
| show_string |
+-------------+
| (0 rows)    |
|             |
+-------------+
>> select * from people;
+-------------------------------+
| show_string                   |
+-------------------------------+
| -RECORD 0-------------------- |
|  current_date() | 2023-07-06  |
|                               |
+-------------------------------+
